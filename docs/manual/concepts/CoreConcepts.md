# Lagom core concepts

Lagom provides tools and APIs that guide developers to build a system out of microservices.  The key to success is good architecture, rooted in a solid understanding of microservices concepts and best practices.

The philosophy behind Lagom is presented in [Reactive Microservices Architecture: Design Principles for Distributed Systems](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/reactive-microservices-architecture.html), a report by Jonas Bon√©r, available free (this link is not working, I get "Get notified when this free report becomes available on Lightbend.com").  We strongly recommend reading it before learning Lagom. Much of the following documentation builds upon and refers back to this report.
